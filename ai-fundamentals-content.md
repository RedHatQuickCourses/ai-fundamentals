### Why should you care about AI?

With AI, computers can now understand human language and show some kind of reasoning capabilities AI provides a mechanism for automating the kinds of tasks that were the sole domain of humans The level of complexity is expanding. The machines are getting better and can adapt quickly based on the data they collect.AI is important now because Moore'sss law has continued to apply to the computing industry, and humanity now has enough computing power at its disposal to approximate human intelligence.

Moore'sss law: The number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years It is named after Gordon Moore, later the co-founder of Intel, who made this prediction in 1975.

Although Moore'sss prediction referred specifically to the number of transistors on a microchip, Moore'sss law has also proven to be accurate with regard to the capabilities of hardware in general and other technology. Advancements such as the reduction in the cost of microprocessors the increase in memory capacity, the improvement of sensors and the number and size of pixels in digital cameras and screens are strongly linked to Moore'sss law.

### What this means for you

Now that technology has improved to the point that AI is viable, AI is changing how we live and work in many ways Many experts have compared the significance of AI and the impact it'ss expected to have to the internet and some believe it will have an even greater impact. Whether you realize it or not, AI is likely already affecting your everyday life, and it is likely to bring changes to your work as well, regardless of your job or role.Organizations across a variety of industries are investing heavily in AI and betting vast sums The next section of the course takes a look at the sheer size of the AI market.

### The AI market opportunity

AI is on almost everyone'sss mind right now, and it has rapidly become critical for businesses and organizations AI-related technology has become more readily available and accessible to businesses of all sizes

As a consequence, there is an increase in demand for AI workloads and investments in AI technologies Businesses are ready to use their ever-increasing data to predict business results and automate their operations

### AI is not a 'ssnice to have'ssit'sss a 'ssmust have'ss

Across all verticals AI is being adopted horizontally across all industries

A 2025 survey (https//www.thomsonreuterscom/en-uspostscorporatesc-suite-survey-2025/) of C-suite executives conducted by the Thomson Reuters Institute revealed that 85 believe AI will have a transformational or high impact on their businesses over the next five years

According to recent surveys 78 of enterprise organizations report using AI in at least one business function, an increase from 55 just a year prior. The use of generative AI has been particularly explosive, with 71 of organizations now regularly using it, up from 33 in 2023.

Keep in mind, the aggregate figures mentioned above do not reflect the uneven pattern of adoption across industries company sizes and functional areas

### The market for AI solutions is large and growing larger

It'sss probably no surprise that the AI market is large, but just how large is it?According to a report from Gartner (https//www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/pressreleases2025-09-17-gartner-saysworldwide-ai-spending-will-total-1-point-5-trillion-in-2025), worldwide spending on AI is predicted to total nearly 1.5 trillion in 2025 and exceed 2 trillion in 2026. These figures represent a comprehensive view of the entire AI-enabled economy, including not only direct spending on AI software and services but also the hardware and infrastructure required to support it.Although other estimates tend to be more conservative and based on targeted aspects of the AI market, there is broad agreement among analysts and experts that the AI market is large and growing larger. For example, IDC (https//info.idc.com/futurescape-generative-ai-2025-predictionshtml) forecasts that global enterprises will invest 307 billion on direct AI solutions in 2025 and expects that figure to grow to 632 billion by 2028.

### That'ss a lot of money!

It is And some of that money will be spent by your employers partners customers colleagues and competitors The vast sums spent on AI reflect the degree of potential transformation that AI is bringing to the world.

As of this writing, some analysts and observers have suggested that there is an AI-related financial 'ssbubble'ss (a period of speculative frenzy in which asset prices rise to unsustainable levels far exceeding their fundamental value). Although it'sss impossible to say for sure whether AI-related assets are financially overvalued at this moment, the idea that there may be an 'ssAI bubble'ss is distinct from the concept of AI as a transformational technology with the potential to have a greater impact on society than even the internet or cellular phones And, as with previous bubbles (e.g., the 'ssdotcom bubble'ss, if there is in fact an AI bubble, there will be companies that first survive and then thrive after the downturn passes

It might help to think of AI as a 'sssmart'ss computer program that learns from experience and can make decisions like a human would, but usually much faster and with more data. AI is used in things like voice assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), self-driving cars and in retail applications that recommend products similar to those you have purchased in the past. AI tries to mimic human thinking to solve problems and perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Consider a user who interacts with ChatGPT. The user enters a text prompt and gets a result. But what happens in between? Between the prompt and the result the user receives is matha lot of math. Mass quantities of data are fed into computationally expensive algorithms

### A person without a technical background asks 'ssWhat is AI?'ss

How should you respond? Begin by defining AI in simple terms'ssArtificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.'ss

### 🖼️ Image: Image Content
**Alt Text:** What is artificial intelligence? Graphic includes three definitions of artificial intelligence. First, from MIT:

Suppose your conversation partner needs a more robust definition? Consider incorporating the following information into your conversation:Artificial intelligence is a multidisciplinary branch of computer science that simulates human intelligence processes in machines These processes include:Learning (gaining information and rules for using the information)Reasoning (applying rules to arrive at conclusionsSelf-correction AI systems can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. In other words AI describes systems capable of acquiring knowledge and applying insights to enable problem solving.

AI is a vast topic. This course is meant to introduce you to the basics of AI; it will not make you an AI expert. The goal of this course is to enable you to have an informal conversation about AI with colleagues customers and friends

Machine learning (ML) is a subcategory of AI that uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions within a set of data. This data can consist of numbers text, or even photos Under ideal conditions ML allows humans to interpret data more quickly and more accurately than they would ever be able to on their own. For instance, ML can be used to anticipate consumer buying patterns based on seasonal factors website traffic, and so forth.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are often linked in conversation. This typically is abbreviated as AI/ML.

### What is deep learning?

Deep learning is a specialized form of ML that teaches computers to process data using an algorithm inspired by the human brain. Deep learning teaches computers to learn through observation, imitating the way humans gain knowledge. A deep learning model uses neural networks with three or more computational layersbut typically hundreds or thousands of layersto train the models

Neural networks benefit greatly from graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware. The reason has to do with how, at their core, neural networks work with mathematics through matrix multiplication. This is the same type of math that video game graphics use; hardware originally meant for making video games more realistic has found new value in the AI era.

### Predictive AI in your daily life

Whether you realize it or not, you likely interact with predictive AI daily.

To learn more about everyday examples of predictive AI, click either the right-facing arrow or the red Start button below.

### 📋 Interactive Process

**Introduction:** Everyday examples of predictive AI
Let'ss take a quick look at some everyday examples of predictive AI.

**Summary:** Continue to the next topic.
Click the Continue bar below to progress to the next topic.

**Step 3:** Text autocompletion: Google 
Every time you use Google to conduct a web search, you interact with AI. When you enter text into Google'sss search box, Google uses AI to offer you autocompletion options for your search as you type. Google'sss AI bases its predictive search completion on the history of previous searches by other users among other data.

**Step 4:** Text autocompletion: Text messaging
Similar to Google searches the autocomplete functionality available with most SMS messaging programs uses AI to predict which word the user is likely to enter next.

**Step 5:** Text autocompletion: Text messaging (cont)
Notice how the iPhone user is offered three options for words that seem likely to follow 'ssCan'sst'ss in this context. The messaging application on the iPhone is using AI to predict which word the user is likely to enter next.

**Step 6:** Online retailer recommendations
When retail websites such as Amazon offer you recommendations of items to purchase, that'sss another example of predictive AI at work.Amazon makes recommendations based on customersss interests and what they have purchased before, and how they have rated their previous purchases In addition, Amazon'sss AI has access to data regarding other customersss purchases and uses that to provide targeted recommendations For example, suppose you are purchasing an iPad on Amazon, and place the iPad in your cart. Amazon then indicates that other customers who purchased iPads also purchased a certain screen protector and a particular type of case. Based on this recommendation, you add the screen protector and case to your cart.

**Step 7:** Movie and music recommendations
Streaming applications such as Netflix and Spotify use predictive AI to make viewing or listening recommendations Suppose you just watched the 1979 film Alien on Netflix, and the application now suggests you watch Mad Max: Fury Road. How does Netflix arrive at this recommendation? Put very simply, data regarding the film you watched (as well as data regarding your viewing preferences and those of other Netflix users including other users who watched Alien) is fed into a model that data scientists have created or trained.

**Step 8:** “Data scientists”? What’s “data science”?
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that leverages mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It encompasses various processes from data collection and cleaning to analysis and visualization, ultimately driving decision making in a wide range of domains Data scientists extract knowledge and insight from data and help organizations ask the right questions about what they need AI models to do. Examples of activities data scientists engage in include:Data collection from various sources including databases APIs files and streaming platformsData cleaning to remove errors handle missing values and format the data for analysis Selection of the appropriate AI models or algorithms and training these models using data and evaluate their performance using a variety of metricsEvaluation and validation of the models to confirm that they perform as expectedData scientists use various tools to accomplish their tasks including such things as Jupyter Notebooks PyTorch, and TensorFlow.Data scientists are among the people most likely to be working with Red Hat'sss AI solutions They tend to not be interested in underlying infrastructure concerns in the same way that IT operations personnel are.

### Optimizing route planning

Logistics companies such as UPS use predictive AI to optimize route planning, based on data from previous deliveries and forecast the ideal route for delivery trucksDelivery route planning must account for such factors as traffic, fuel consumption, weather conditions and safety considerations This planning can quickly become complex when drivers need to make more than 100 stops each day; however, determining the optimal route can reduce costs increase efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.According to its website, UPS delivers 22.3 million packages and documents daily; however, it only has approximately 135,000 trucks and other road vehicles in its fleet. How does UPS deliver so many packages with so few trucks Predictive AI is part of what makes this level of efficiency possible.

By applying predictive AI to package delivery, and accounting for 'sspredicted'ss packages along with known packages UPS annually saves an estimated 18.5 million miles 35 million, 800,000 gallons of fuel, and 18,500 metric tons of emissions

With predictive AI, UPS is able to predict the likelihood of a successful delivery based on such factors as location, loss frequency, returns volume, and number of delivery attempts The AI groups these factors and can assign a score to a delivery address that reflects the likelihood of successful delivery.

UPS was able to determine that 2 of 'sslow-confidence'ss addresses were involved in 30 of package losses

The technology allows businesses that use UPS and their customers to reroute the most at-risk shipments to a UPS Store or UPS Access Point, giving them alternatives to ensure smooth deliveries and a great customer experience. The solution can also be built into a businesssss ordering platform to improve their delivery outcomes

### Benefits of using predictive AI in logistics

Among the many benefits predictive AI offers logistics companies are the following:Reduced cost, time to deliver, and resource use: By using predictive AI for such things as route optimization, UPS and other logistics companies can reduce cost, deliver more quickly, and reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissionsPrevention of package theft: By using predictive AI to identify delivery addresses where package theft is most likely to take place, logistics companies can prevent theft by allowing for package rerouting to more secure locations

- **Access:** Open SCORM zip → scormcontent/assets/nmmmtB/stock-image.jpg

Previously, HSBC employed a rulesbased system to review transactions for signs of money laundering, which involved setting parameters for transactions the bank'sss automated monitoring system should identify. Transactions tagged as suspicious were then investigated on a case-by-case basis however, this resulted in a great deal of false positives (i.e., legal transactions that still needed to be investigated by HSBC'sss human investigators.HSBC used its financial expertise to train its AI model to detect suspicious activity with more precision than its previous rulesbased system. This led to the following benefitsMore accurate risk detection: The new AI system reduced the overall number of alerts by 60 while correctly identifying two to four times as much suspicious activity as the previous system.Reduced investigation time: Fewer alerts meant investigators spent less time reviewing clean transactions As a result, HSBC was able to decrease the time it takes from first alert to detect a suspicious account.Better success in identifying criminal networks HSBC'sss new system is better than the previous system at identifying networks of criminals working together to try and launder money.Improved customer satisfaction: Fewer false positives meant the bank spent less time contacting legitimate, law-abiding customers and taking up their time with, ultimately, unnecessary transaction reviews

### Providing AI-enhanced accounts in mobile apps

With predictive AI, Wells Fargo analyzes customerss account information to provide tailored guidance and tips for better financial decision-making.For example, the feature flags higher-than-normal automatic monthly payments and offers reminders to prompt customers to transfer money from one account to another to avoid a possible upcoming overdraft. If a customer seems to have more money than usual in a particular month, they may be prompted to transfer money into savings

### Benefits of using predictive AI in banking

Among the many benefits predictive AI offers banks are the following:More accurate fraud and money laundering detection: By using predictive AI, banks such as HSBC can identify money laundering with fewer false positives which means human investigators are able to focus on the suspicious accounts most likely to be associated with illegal activity and spend less time reviewing transactions made by legitimate, law-abiding customersTailored guidance and prompts for account holders Banks use predictive AI to help their customers identify unusually high automatic payments and prompt customers to transfer sufficient funds to avoid potential overdrafts

### What is a large language model (LLM)?

A large language model (LLM) is a type of AI program designed to understand and generate human language. It'sss referred to as 'sslarge'ss because it'sss built on huge amounts of text data, which it uses to learn patterns and relationships in language. LLMs can answer questions generate text, translate languages and perform other language-related tasks with a high level of accuracy and fluency.

Since November 2022, when ChatGPT launched, people have tended to conflate LLMs with AI in general. In reality, AI is the broader topic and LLMs are advanced tools within the larger AI ecosystem.

It takes an incredible amount of resources and expertise to create an LLM; the vast majority of organizations are not capable of building their own LLM. LLMs are what make chatbots such as ChatGPT possible, and they enable the seemingly limitless potential that AI has to offer.

### Using models with generative AI

Very few organizations have the resources data, and expertise necessary to build their own LLMs from scratch (this is sometimes referred to as model training). Organizations that are interested in generative AI will most likely start by using one of several foundation models however, those models require additional work before they can be used effectively. There are a variety of approaches for accomplishing this

A foundation model is a type of ML model pretrained to perform a range of tasks Foundation models are programmed to function with a general contextual understanding of patterns structures and representations This foundational comprehension of how to communicate and identify patterns creates a baseline of knowledge that can be modified, or fine-tuned, to perform domain-specific tasks for just about any industry. Examples of foundation models include GPT, Claude, and Llama.

### Interactive Accordion

**Tokens**
Tokens are small units of textsuch as words subwords or characters that have semantic meaning for a model. To process language, LLMs break down text into tokens These tokens are how the model 'ssreadsss and 'sswritesss language, helping it understand meaning, context, and grammar. For a general sense of the word-to-context ratio, a sentence containing 10 words might be 15 to 20 tokensEvery model has a limit to the number of tokens that can be included in the input prompt as well as the number of tokens that appear in the generated output from the model. This limit is sometimes called context window length or context window.In many ways tokens represent the currency of AI, and token cost is likely to be a consideration for enterprise organizations using AI.

**Model training**
Model training refers to the initial phase of building the AI/ML model in which the model learns from a large dataset to understand patterns relationships and features in the data. Creating AI foundation models from scratch can be very resource- and time-intensive and is in reach of only a few enterprise customers

**Fine-tuning**
Fine-tuning is a technique that involves taking a pretrained generative AI model and further training it on a specific dataset or for a specific task. Fine-tuning requires a labeled dataset that is specific to the task to train the model with examples of input-output pairs related to that task. Although fine-tuning requires significantly less data than the original training process it still generally involves a large investment of resources and vast amounts of data. In general, fine-tuning is more involved and labor intensive than prompt-tuning.

**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a method for getting better answers from a generative AI application by linking an LLM to an external resource. RAG provides a means to supplement the data that exists within an LLM with external knowledge sourcesfor example, data repositories collections of text, and pre-existing documentation. These resources are segmented, indexed in a vector database, and used as reference material to deliver more accurate answers RAG is useful because it directs the LLM to retrieve specific, real-time information from a chosen source (or sources of truth. RAG can save money by providing a custom experience without the expense of model training and fine-tuning. It can also save resources by sending only the most relevant information (rather than lengthy documents when querying an LLM. As of this writing, RAG is one of the most popular approaches to working with foundation models

**Prompt engineering**
Prompt engineering refers to the process of carefully crafting prompts entered into LLMs to generate accurate, high-quality outputs It does not require coding skills it requires clear communication, logic, and an understanding of how the AI worksEffective prompting starts with structure. There is no single right way to do it, but successful approaches share a consistent design logic: they make intent explicit and repeatable. One useful structure frames each interaction around these four elements Context: Supply the background and objectives Role: Assign the model a perspective or domain identity. Clarification: Encourage the model to ask questions before acting. Task: Assign a specific job to perform. This is only one of many proven methods Several other prompt engineering frameworks have emerged across the industry, each emphasizing a different aspect of clarity and control. These frameworks share the same intent: to transform prompting from ad hoc experimentation into a disciplined design practice.Prompt engineering requires less technical knowledge than prompt-tuning.

**Prompt-tuning**
Taking the discipline of prompt engineering to a new level, prompt-tuning is a technique data scientists use to optimize the prompts or instructions a user gives to an AI model to experiment with different prompt formats and wording to achieve the desired results In some cases prompt-tuning allows organizations to adapt models and achieve 'ssgood enough'ss accuracy but to do it with less resources Prompt-tuning requires more technical knowledge than prompt engineering; it involves using a small, specialized dataset to train a set of numeric vectors (often referred to as 'ssoft promptss that are prepended to the input. Unlike prompt engineering, prompt-tuning requires data science expertise.Prompt-tuning is often contrasted with fine-tuning AI models which tends to require more effort and resources

**Model inferencing**
Model inferencing is the phase in which the trained AI/ML model is put to use and can make predictions generate text, classify data, or perform any other task it was designed for. During inference, the trained model takes in new, unseen data and produces outputs based on its learned patterns

The following lesson covers model inferencing in more depth.

### Potential issues with LLMs

As incredibly powerful as LLMs are, there are issues associated with them that you should be aware of as you discuss AI.

### Massive energy, water, and resource costs

Building an LLM from scratch is prohibitively expensive for most organizations Of course, there'sss the hardware that'sss required, along with data centers and other expensesand that'sss before you factor in the cost of training the LLM.The energy cost alone associated with training and maintaining an LLM is staggering, both from financial and sustainability perspectives For example, training GPT-3 (with its 175 billion parameters consumed an estimated 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity, which is roughly equivalent to the energy consumption of an average American household over 120 years

### 🖼️ Image: Image Content
**Alt Text:** Photo of an LED lightbulb Text: 'sA single LLM interaction may consume as much power as leaving a low-brightness LED lightbulb on for one hour.'s - Alex de Vries VU Amsterdam

- **Dimensions:** 1205x349 pixels
- **Access:** Open SCORM zip → scormcontent/assets/LEDbulb1.jpg

In addition to the electricity demands of LLMs such models also require a tremendous amount of water to cool the hardware and data centers used by LLMs According to scientists from the University of California, Riverside (https//arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03271), the global AI demand for water is projected to account for 4.2 to 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than half of the annual water withdrawal of the entire United Kingdom. Even the cost of maintaining an LLM is exceptional. Consider this Back in 2023, according to research firm SemiAnalysis (https//newsletter.semianalysiscom/p/the-inference-cost-of-search-disruption), it cost OpenAI approximately 700,000 a day in compute hardware costs to operate ChatGPT. That'sss about 255 million a year; however, the current cost of operating ChatGPT is likely much greater. An estimate included in a TechCrunch (http://echcrunch.com/2025/11/14/leaked-documentsshed-light-into-how-much-openai-paysmicrosoft/::textWAITLIST20NOW,the20first20half20of202025.) story had OpenAI spending roughly 3.8 billion on inference in 2024 and an estimated 8.65 billion on inference in the first nine months of 2025.

### Issues with transparency in model building

In most instances there is no way to know for sure which sources were used to create and train a particular LLM. As the user of the LLM, you have no way of knowing for certain whether the content used to train the model was accurate, which could lead to flawed, incomplete, or erroneous results

### Bias and model building

Unfortunately, it is impossible to prevent biases from leaking into models which can affect output. For example, minorities may be underrepresented in the data used to train the model, which may lead to skewed outcomes A 2023 study found that four recently published LLMs were three to six times more likely to choose an occupation that stereotypically aligns with a person'sss gender than what official occupation data would suggest. And despite the best intentions of the model creators there is a risk of overcorrection for bias (such as racial bias, that leads to historically inaccurate results

### Hallucinations

Sometimes LLMs can generate responses that appear coherent, grammatically correct, and are stated in a manner that suggests they are accurate, when in fact, they are nonsensical or factually incorrect. Such responses are generally referred to as hallucinations For example, consider how ChatGPT 3.5 responded to the following prompt in July 2024: How many 'ssm'sss are there in 'ssWeather'ss

- **Access:** Open SCORM zip → scormcontent/assets/ChatGPT_3_5b.jpg

Later versions of ChatGPT are more likely to answer this question correctly. On a similar note, some older versions of LLMs had issues with counting the number of R'sss in 'ssStrawberry.'ss This flaw is a perfect demonstration of tokenization. LLMs don'st process text character-by-character; they use larger chunks called tokens Instead of seeing ten individual letters (S-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y), the model might see the word broken into just two tokens such as 'sStraw's and 'sberry's. Because the model treats 'sberry's as a single, indivisible unit of meaning, it processes the entire block without breaking it down into its constituent letters The three 'sR'sss are therefore hidden inside these larger tokens which made it difficultor in some cases impossiblefor the model to perform the character-level counting task accurately.

Content generated by AI should be reviewed by humans to confirm its accuracy.

### Issues related to data recency

The information that LLMs have been trained on doesn'sst continuously gather updates there'sss an effective 'sscutoff'ss date to an LLM'sss knowledge. As a result, that source material can become outdated and no longer relevant.Data scientists and researchers may use RAG to address such issues For example, implementing RAG architecture into an LLM-based question-answering system provides a line of communication between an LLM and the chosen additional knowledge sources The LLM is able to crossreference and supplement its internal knowledge, providing a more reliable and accurate output for the user making a query.

### Issues related to data sovereignty

Data sovereignty refers to the principle that data (such as personal information, financial records or intellectual property) is subject to the laws and regulations of the country or region (such as the European Union) where it is collected, processed, or stored. Many nations have laws related to data sovereignty. When it comes to LLMs and data sovereignty, it matters a great deal who owns and operates that LLM, where that LLM'ss servers are located (which may not always be obvious to the end user of the LLM), and what data may have been used to train that model.Consider the following example. A user in Country A enters a prompt containing sensitive data into an LLM, and that LLM has its servers in Country B. The user in Country A has likely lost control of that data, which now could be stored in Country B, used to train future models or inadvertently exposed to other users of the LLMall in violation of Country A'ss data privacy laws

Red Hat'ss open hybrid cloud portfolio, including Red Hat AI, provides sovereignty solutions to address such issues

### Risks related to copyright and privacy

There may be copyright or other legal issues associated with the content used to train the LLM.For example, suppose that an LLM was trained on copyrighted material without the permission of the respective copyright holders If your organization were to use that LLM, and you inadvertently violated the rights of copyright holders your organization could be at risk of being sued.

This legal issue is not merely theoretical; in December 2023, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, contending that millions of articles published by the newspaper were used to train chatbots As of this writing, the case is pending.In December 2025, the New York Times sued Perplexity AI, claiming that the artificial intelligence startup repeatedly violated the newspaper'ss copyrights by copying, distributing, and displaying Times articles without permission.

There are also privacy issues associated with LLMs There is no way to get an LLM to 'ssforget'ss information it'sss been trained on. It'sss not like a spreadsheet, where you could delete a column that contained private information such as dates of birth, Social Security numbers or sensitive medical information. Also, as it becomes easier to use AI to create so-called 'ssdeepfakesss (i.e., highly convincing fake or manipulated information, such as photos videos or audio recordings, the opportunities to use AI to engage in unethical or illegal behavior increase.

### Risks of mass adoption

Currently, there are multiple LLMs in use; however, if one model overwhelmingly beats the competition, and that LLM is effectively, the only LLM, it could change society'sss common understanding of history based on quirks in how the model was trained.

Red Hat believes that the future of AI involves open source practices and transparency in datasets

### What is inferencing?

Inferencing, in the context of AI, is the process of running an AI model to generate responses an AI model provides an answer based on data. What some people generally call 'ssAI'ss is really the success of AI inference: the final stepthe 'ssaha'ss momentin a long and complex process of ML technology. AI inference is where the business value happens and the end result is delivered.Training AI models with sufficient data can help improve AI inference accuracy and speed.

### What is an inference server?

An inference server is the crucial piece of software infrastructure that hosts a trained ML model, making the AI ready for real-time use by end-users or other applications The server receives an input request (a prompt, a query, or data), feeds it through the trained model, and generates a real-time output or conclusion based on the model'ss learned patternsthis applies equally to predictive AI (like scoring a recommendation) and generative AI (like creating text or images. While inference servers are necessary for any ML model serving, the current industry focus is heavily centered around the high-demand requirements for LLM serving, which require significant memory and computing resources to perform inference at scale.To infer is to conclude based on evidence. For example, you may see your friend'sss living room light on, but you don'sst see them. You may infer that your friend is home, but you don'sst have absolute evidence to prove it.An LLM also doesn'sst have absolute evidence about the meaning of a word or phrase (it'sss a piece of software), so it uses its training as evidence. In a series of calculations based on data, it generates a conclusion. Just like when you calculate that if the light is off, it means your friend is out.To perform effectively, LLMs need extensive storage, memory, and infrastructure to inference at scale.

### What are the trade-offs regarding inferencing?

When moving from a proof-of-concept to production, the demands of AI solutions change significantly. It'ss not just about a clever model anymore. Organizations need to pay attention to user expectations the budget, and the level of responsiveness an IT system should have. Optimizing for one thing often impacts another; optimal inference requires identifying the trade-offsUsers expect a lot of their interaction with models that interaction needs to be fast and provide accurate responsesModel inference can be expensive if processing times and length of model responses aren'sst measured and controlled.All areas of the organization expect business operations won'sst be affected by low throughput and high latency.

### Scaling LLM inference

Operationalizing AI models at scale is a critical challenge for IT leaders Effectively serving LLMs at scale requires a strategic, full-stack approach that addresses both the model itself and the serving runtime. A single approach is not enough. Achieving high performance and cost efficiency requires a dual focusmanaging resource consumption and maximizing throughput.

### What is distributed inference?

Distributed inference lets AI models process workloads more efficiently by dividing the labor of inference across a group of interconnected devices Think of it as the software equivalent of the saying, 'ssmany hands make light work.'ss Distributed inference supports a system that splits requests across a fleet of hardware, which can include physical and cloud servers From there, each inference server processes its assigned portion in parallel to create an output. The result is a resilient and observable system for delivering consistent and scalable AI-powered services

### How does distributed inference work?

Distributed inference works by giving AI models a single, intelligent coordinator that acts as the brain for AI workloads When a new request comes in, distributed inference helps analyze the request and route it to the best part of the hardware system for the job.Large models too many users or latency issues can all hinder performance. Depending on the issue causing the bottleneck, distributed inference uses several strategiesDividing the model: If the model is too large for one GPU, distributed inference uses model parallelism to divide the model across multiple GPUsDividing the data: To handle many users at once, it uses data parallelism and intelligent load balancing to divide the input data across servers This efficiently manages concurrent requestsDividing the inference process To optimize the entire workflow, it uses process disaggregation. This separates the two computational phases that create an inference response (prefill and decode) and runs them in separate environments

### What is optimization in the context of AI?

### 🖼️ Image: Image Content
**Description:** We hear a lot about groundbreaking AI innovations incredible new models and the amazing things that they can do. But there'ss a quieter, often overlooked challenge that'ss crucial for actually making AI work in the real world, and that'ss optimization. So what exactly is optimization in the context of AI? It'ss not just about saving money.

Optimization is about unlocking performance, reliability, and reach. An optimized model delivers faster predictions uses less memory, and can run on more diverse hardware. It extends the life of existing infrastructure and allows AI to serve more users with fewer resources

Think of it this way: Innovation is like designing a sleek, powerful sports car. It'ss exciting. It'ss groundbreaking. But optimization, that'ss making sure that your car can actually drive on everyday roads reliably and affordably without guzzling all your fuel. Remember: If AI can'st scale, it can'st succeed.Training an AI model gets all the headlines It'ss where the model learns But inference is the day-to-day act of putting that trained model to work, making predictions powering applications in real time. And this is where cost, latency, and user experience really collide.Too often, AI systems are built with massive oversized models chosen purely for their benchmark performance. It'ss like using a sledgehammer to tighten a loose screw. The result, excessive GPU usage, frustrating latency, and infrastructure costs that quietly add up. And with the rise of huge foundation models like Llama, Mistral, and DeepSeek, the computational cost of inference has gone through the roof. Optimization isn'st just an option anymore; it'ss essential to make these models usable at scale.

Optimization makes AI powerful and practical.

### What are some key optimization techniques

Let'ss take a look at some key optimization techniques

### Interactive Accordion

**Quantization**
This reduces the numerical precision of the model, making it smaller and faster. For example, Red Hat'ss evaluations on Llama models showed a 3.5 times size reduction and a 2.4 time speed up with almost no loss in accuracy.

**Batching**
This groups multiple inference requests together, improving throughput without changing the model itself.

**Caching**
This eliminates redundant computations especially useful for repeated or similar queries

**Pruning and distillation**
These techniques reduce model complexity by removing unnecessary parts or training smaller models to mimic the performance of larger ones

Every optimization involves trade-offs In critical applications such as those related to healthcare or finance, even a tiny shift in accuracy can have major consequences Optimization techniques should be carefully evaluated to properly balance precision with performance goals

### What is agentic AI?

Agentic AI is an AI system designed to interact with data and tools in a way that requires minimal human intervention. With an emphasis on goal-oriented behavior, agentic AI can accomplish tasks by creating a list of steps and performing them autonomously.Unlike traditional AI models which operate within predefined constraints and require a greater degree of human intervention, agentic AI exhibits autonomy, goal-driven behavior, and adaptability. The term agentic refers to these modelsss agency, or, their capacity to act independently and purposefully.

While AI has already redefined how we interact with data, automate tasks and serve customers the next phase in AI is emerging, pushing beyond content generation and predictive analytics

Think of agentic AI as a way of combining automation with the creative abilities of an LLM. To bring agentic AI to practice, you create a system that provides an LLM with access to external tools and algorithms that supply instructions for how the AI agents should use those toolsThe way agents communicate with tools involves orchestration, with flows or graphs depending on the framework being used. This approach allows the LLM to 'ssreason'ss and determine the best way to answer a questionsuch as deciding whether the query can be answered with available information or whether an external search is necessary.

### What is an AI agent?

Think of an AI agent as an entity that sits on top of other software tools and operates them. Agentic AI can be a physical structure, a software program, or a combination of the two.

An AI agent in a robotic system might use cameras sensors and monitors to collect data about its environment, then run that information alongside software to make determinations about its next step. This is a process known as sensor fusion. Meanwhile, agentic AI in a software setting would collect data from other sources such as APIs online searches text prompts and databases that help the agents create a sense of perception and context.

### Interactive Accordion

**Agentic AI is adaptive and dynamic.**
Agentic AI learns from previous patterns and data. This means that it can change its strategy based on new or changing information it receives in real time. While traditional workflows only move forward, agentic workflows can move forward and backward, with the ability to backtrack and mend errors as it goes In other words agentic AI can proactively anticipate needs and reflect on its own work.For example, an autonomous vehicle may use agentic AI to improve its ability to sense the difference between a piece of trash on the road and a squirrel. As it continuously monitors and analyzes its own behavior, it can improve the outcome of its actions

**Agentic AI can independently manage and complete tasks**
Agentic AI is sometimes referred to as autonomous AI. This is because it has the capability to communicate and collaborate with other AI systems and digital infrastructures on behalf of a human user, or another AI agent.For example, you can tell an AI agent that you want to make spaghetti for dinner. The AI agent could then complete the steps necessary to find a recipe, make a list of ingredients and place an order for those ingredients to be delivered to your home from a local grocery store.

**Agentic AI has a 'sschaining'ss ability.**
The AI system can perform a sequence of actions in response to a single request. For example, if you ask an AI agent to 'sscreate a website,'ss it can perform all the steps needed to carry out that task. This means that from one prompt, the AI agent can carry out the tasks of writing the code for the structure, populating the pages with content, designing the visuals and testing for responsiveness

### What is an agentic workflow?

Agentic AI brings us closer to creating intelligent systems that can operate independently, collaborate effectively, and learn from their interactions with data. Agentic AI works because of a process known as an agentic workflow.

An agentic workflow is a structured series of actions managed and completed by AI agents

When an AI agent is given a goal to complete, it begins the workflow by breaking down a task into smaller individual steps then performing those stepsTo carry out this series of steps an AI agent spins up more versions of itself, creating a multi-agent system (MAS). In this workflow, the main agent (also known as a meta agent, orchestrator, or supervisor) delegates tasks to other agents assigning values and interacting with memory in a feedback loop. Together, the committee of agents work in parallel until the overall goal is complete.Within this MAS, each agent is made up of an internal structure that allows it to function both independently and collaboratively within its system. This collaboration is dependent on shared memory stores which provide context regarding individual knowledge, past experiences and belief states

### Agentic AI vs generative AI

Both agentic AI and generative AI offer productivity benefits by assisting, augmenting, and optimizing tasks and processes Both are forms of AI that use LLMsWhen comparing the two, think of agentic AI as proactive and generative AI as reactive.Agentic AI is a system that can proactively set and complete goals with minimal human oversight. If part of accomplishing that goal involves creating content, generative AI tools handle that task. Agentic AI becomes an agent of the user and/or system.Generative AI is a tool that creates new content in reaction to a prompt. It can be a component of an agentic system, but it doesn'sst act on its own to complete a task. It has no agency.Agentic AI and generative AI do work collaboratively. Agentic AI systems may use generative AI to converse with a user, independently create content as part of a greater goal, or communicate with external tools generative AI is a critical part of agentic AI'sss 'sscognitive'ss process Both types of AI are adaptable in their own way. Generative AI expresses its adaptability by producing content in many styles and for different contexts Agentic AI showcases its adaptability by adjusting its plan and strategy in response to changing environmental conditions or new information.

### Let'ss consider a hypothetical use case.

Imagine a sales representative wants to use AI to write a follow-up email to a sales lead.With generative AI, the sales representative opens a generative AI interface and enters a prompt like, 'ssWrite a polite and professional follow-up email to Maria Wang about our proposal.'ss The generative AI produces a draft of the email and has fulfilled its purpose. It'sss now up to the sales representative to copy that text, paste it into an email, enter the recipient'sss email address and hit send.Now let'sss explore how agentic AI would handle a similar task.Within an agentic system, the sales representative sets a rule or command in their customer relationship management (CRM) system. It might read something like, 'ssFor any sales lead I mark as 'ssFollow-up required,'ss wait two business days then send a follow-up email.'ssOnce the sales representative marks Maria Wang as 'ssFollow-up required,'ss the agentic workflow is triggered. The system has its instructions (the initial prompt) and independently lays out a plan to enact with the help of external tools The plan may look something like this

### 📋 Interactive Process

**Introduction:** The agentic workflow
Once the sales representative marks Maria Wang as 'ssFollow-up required,'ss the agentic workflow is triggered. The system has its instructions (the initial prompt) and independently lays out a plan to enact with the help of external tools The plan may look something like this

**Summary:** The end
Continue to the next topic.

**Step 3:** Process Step
After two business days the system sends a request to the agentic workflow.

**Step 4:** Process Step
The system retrieves Maria'sss details from the CRM.

**Step 5:** Process Step
Another tool fetches additional information about Maria (customer history, personalization details company information, etc.) that provides context for the prompt for the follow-up email.

**Step 6:** Process Step
The system creates a prompt for the follow-up email and provides it to an integrated gen AI model, which writes the email text.

**Step 7:** Process Step
The system provides a draft of the follow-up email to the sales representative, who approves the email or sends it back to redraft.

**Step 8:** Process Step
If the sales representative approves the email, the system makes an application programming interface (API) call to Maria'sss email service.

**Step 9:** Process Step
The system sends the email to Maria.

**Step 10:** Process Step
The system updates the CRM to show the email has been sent.

### What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open source protocol, introduced by Anthropic, that enables two-way connection and standardized communication between AI applications and external services

An open source protocol, or set of instructions is like a recipe for code that'sss freely available to use and contribute to.

MCP defines how models can call external tools retrieve data, and interact with services to enhance their capabilities It provides a simplified and reliable way for AI systems to virtually 'ssplug in'ss to different data sources and tools Think of MCP as a USB-C cable that connects devices to accessories and allows for transmission of data.

### How does MCP communication work?

MCP is based on the client-host-server model, also known as the client-server model, which includesMCP client: The AI application or system that requests access to external data or resourcesMCP host: The infrastructure (virtual machine, container, or serverless function) that manages communication between the client and server.MCP server: The component that provides specific tools resources and capabilities to the client.MCP begins with a handshake protocol. This initial greetingalso known as a capability discoveryconfirms that the MCP client and the MCP server can talk to each other.During the handshake protocol, the MCP client and the MCP server swap critical information to ensure they'ssre compatible. The client shares which capabilities it has and which version of MCP it understands In return, the server shares which capabilities it supports and which tools and resources it can provide to the client.

### MCP and agentic AI

MCP and agentic AI enable each other to create intelligent AI systems With MCP, AI systems can interact with the broader digital ecosystem to accomplish tasks for users Without MCP, agentic AI can think and plan (all the traits of generative AI), but can'sst interact with any outside systems

Although rapid adoption of MCP by major industry players may make it seem as though it will become the standard for AI tool integration, it is not the only option. Examples of other protocols include LangChain Agent Protocol and Google'ss Agent2Agent (A2A).

### AI security

AI security focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AI systems The goal is to prevent malicious actors from attacking or manipulating those systems AI security involves protecting against threats that can arise from:Exploitation of vulnerabilities in software componentsMisconfigured systems or broken authentication allowing unauthorized access to sensitive enterprise data.Prompt injection (a type of security vulnerability or attack in which a user attempts to hijack or manipulate the AI model'ss instructions by sneaking in unauthorized or malicious commands within their input, that is the prompt).Model 'ssjailbreaking'ss (bypassing safety guardrails for example, ethical, legal, or content policies to generate restricted, harmful, or prohibited content).

### AI safety

In AI contexts safety means trustworthiness fairness and ethical alignment. AI safety helps maintain the intended behavior of AI systems keeping them aligned with company policies regulations and ethical standards The risks surrounding AI safety are less about system compromise and more related to what an AI system produces Issues related to AI safety include:Harmful or toxic language (for example, an AI model'ss responses could contain offensive or abusive content).Bias or discrimination in responsesHallucinations (plausible-sounding but false answers.Dangerous or misleading recommendations (for example, suggesting that users put glue on pizza or swallow drain cleaner to treat a sore throat).

### Detecting AI security threats

Organizations looking to protect their team and technology often layer their strategiesa single line of defense likely won'sst cut it. Common tactics include the following:

### Interactive Accordion

**Behavioral analysis**
This type of threat detection can catch anomalies and deviations within a network. After tracking typical datasets patterns and activity, it becomes intimately familiar with the AI system'sss typical behavior. When it comes across atypical behavior, such as biased contentor worse, public-facing passwords in cleartext formatit triggers an alert.

**Runtime threat detection**
If an adversary is scanning an environment for possible exploitations existing runtime security can detect repeated probes and sound the alarm. Security teams can automate and enhance this technique with AI to recognize threats and trigger alerts sooner.

**Predictive threat intelligence**
This technology anticipates future events by referencing historical data to make predictions about what will happen next. For example, if an adversary were targeting fintech systems with ransomware, predictive threat intelligence would assess the organizational posture against the likelihood of a successful attack.

**Enhanced data processing**
AI workloads contain a lot of datatypically, billions and billions of data points AI security has to process that data in order to conclude whether it'sss at risk, confidential, or available. Enhanced data processing can detect anomalies and threats in the environment faster than humans or traditional processing technology, so teams can act quickly.

**Attack path analysis**
This strategy involves mapping potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for threats For example, understanding how a threat may enter an organization'ss systems and reach sensitive data helps security teams identify which path an attack would come from and block it.

Elements of a healthy AI security strategy that can help protect an organization'ss AI models data, and privacy include the following best practices

### Interactive Accordion

**Adopting AI guardrails**
Guardrails help generative AI models filter hateful, abusive, or profane speech, personally identifiable information, competitive information, or other domain-specific constraints

**Protecting training data**
AI systems tend to be as reliable as the data they were trained on. Original training data should be secured behind firewalls or other safeguards against tampering or manipulation to protect the model'sss integrity and outputs

**Implementing strong platform security**
Protecting the platform on which AI workloads run can help ensure their health and reliability. If the platform is secure, threat actors have to work harder to inflict harm.

**Focusing on supply chain and systems security**
Organizations should adapt existing best practices in supply chain and systems security to cover AI workloads Just as traditional software supply chain security verifies the integrity of open source libraries AI supply chain security can account for the provenance and integrity of training data, pretrained models and third-party AI components

**Customizing strategies**
AI workloads are unique, rarely fitting into one-size-fitsall security solutions Security strategy should be tailored to an organization'ss individual AI workloads designs and data.

### Using AI responsibly

So what can you as an individual user do to mitigate risks associated with AI security and safety? And how can you use AI responsibly?

• Don'st enter confidential or sensitive information: In general, unless you know otherwise, treat an AI chat window as a public forum. Do not paste any code, internal documents customer names financial figures or unreleased product details into a public-facing LLM (such as free versions of ChatGPT).

• Assume all input is training data: Always assume that any information you input might be used to train future versions of the model, making it discoverable by others Only use anonymized, aggregated, or public data.

• Use approved, internal tools Where available, use company-licensed or approved AI tools that guarantee inputs are not used for training and have strict data retention policies If you'sre unsure, ask your IT department.

• Review all AI-generated output: Although LLM responses to prompts are typically stated in a confident manner, do NOT assume AI-generated output is factual or accurate. AI models can hallucinate (generate false, plausible-sounding information). Always crossreference all facts figures quoted statements citation information, and so forth with verified, trusted internal or external sources In addition, LLMs can sometimes include copyrighted material verbatim in their responses and using such content without the permission of the respective copyright holder could result in copyright infringement.

• Maintain professionalism: Do not engage in inappropriate, biased, or inflammatory conversations with an AI chatbot. Likewise, do not prompt the AI to discuss or comment on internal company politics rival companies unreleased products or sensitive client matters Assume your prompts and conversations could be audited or made public and have a negative impact on your reputation (and that of your employer) if you engage with AI in an unprofessional manner.

• Limit personal sharing: Avoid disclosing any private or sensitive personal details (e.g., home address personal schedules family names to public AI tools as this information can be harvested and used for targeted attacks against you or your colleagues

• Be vigilant regarding social engineering attempts Malicious actors may use AI to craft highly convincing phishing emails deepfake voicemails or seemingly legitimate documents It'ss not enough anymore to look for poorly constructed or written emails Take care before clicking links especially in emails or messages you were not expecting.

• Be skeptical toward any advice an AI may provide: If an AI offers advice on specialized areas (e.g., legal, medical, or financial), keep in mind that AI is no substitute for a licensed professional. Always consult a human expert in these domains

• Be transparent: If you'sve used AI to generate content (e.g., code, text, images or videos, be clear about that with your audience. Include disclaimers or statements regarding AI use to clarify how you used AI and to what degree you used it.

---

### Thinking about your AI conversation

Of course, there'sss no way to prepare you for every possible AI-related conversation you might have. As always do your best to know your audience and tailor your conversation to their interests needs and expertise. Be ready to adapt if the conversation shifts and keep in mind that conversations involve two-way communication.
