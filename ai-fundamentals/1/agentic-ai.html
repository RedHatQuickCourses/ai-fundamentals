<h3 id="_what_is_agentic_ai"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_is_agentic_ai"></a>What is agentic AI?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agentic AI is an AI system designed to interact with data and tools in a way that requires minimal human intervention. With an emphasis on goal-oriented behavior, agentic AI can accomplish tasks by creating a list of steps and performing them autonomously.Unlike traditional AI models which operate within predefined constraints and require a greater degree of human intervention, agentic AI exhibits autonomy, goal-driven behavior, and adaptability. The term agentic refers to these modelsss agency, or, their capacity to act independently and purposefully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While AI has already redefined how we interact with data, automate tasks and serve customers the next phase in AI is emerging, pushing beyond content generation and predictive analytics</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think of agentic AI as a way of combining automation with the creative abilities of an LLM. To bring agentic AI to practice, you create a system that provides an LLM with access to external tools and algorithms that supply instructions for how the AI agents should use those toolsThe way agents communicate with tools involves orchestration, with flows or graphs depending on the framework being used. This approach allows the LLM to 'reason' and determine the best way to answer a questionsuch as deciding whether the query can be answered with available information or whether an external search is necessary.</p>

<p>Think of an AI agent as an entity that sits on top of other software tools and operates them. Agentic AI can be a physical structure, a software program, or a combination of the two.</p>

<p>An AI agent in a robotic system might use cameras sensors and monitors to collect data about its environment, then run that information alongside software to make determinations about its next step. This is a process known as sensor fusion. Meanwhile, agentic AI in a software setting would collect data from other sources such as APIs online searches text prompts and databases that help the agents create a sense of perception and context.</p>

<p><strong>Agentic AI is adaptive and dynamic.</strong>
Agentic AI learns from previous patterns and data. This means that it can change its strategy based on new or changing information it receives in real time. While traditional workflows only move forward, agentic workflows can move forward and backward, with the ability to backtrack and mend errors as it goes In other words agentic AI can proactively anticipate needs and reflect on its own work.For example, an autonomous vehicle may use agentic AI to improve its ability to sense the difference between a piece of trash on the road and a squirrel. As it continuously monitors and analyzes its own behavior, it can improve the outcome of its actions</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Agentic AI can independently manage and complete tasks</strong>
Agentic AI is sometimes referred to as autonomous AI. This is because it has the capability to communicate and collaborate with other AI systems and digital infrastructures on behalf of a human user, or another AI agent.For example, you can tell an AI agent that you want to make spaghetti for dinner. The AI agent could then complete the steps necessary to find a recipe, make a list of ingredients and place an order for those ingredients to be delivered to your home from a local grocery store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Agentic AI has a 'chaining' ability.</strong>
The AI system can perform a sequence of actions in response to a single request. For example, if you ask an AI agent to 'create a website,' it can perform all the steps needed to carry out that task. This means that from one prompt, the AI agent can carry out the tasks of writing the code for the structure, populating the pages with content, designing the visuals and testing for responsiveness</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_an_agentic_workflow"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_is_an_agentic_workflow"></a>What is an agentic workflow?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Agentic AI brings us closer to creating intelligent systems that can operate independently, collaborate effectively, and learn from their interactions with data. Agentic AI works because of a process known as an agentic workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An agentic workflow is a structured series of actions managed and completed by AI agents</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an AI agent is given a goal to complete, it begins the workflow by breaking down a task into smaller individual steps then performing those stepsTo carry out this series of steps an AI agent spins up more versions of itself, creating a multi-agent system (MAS). In this workflow, the main agent (also known as a meta agent, orchestrator, or supervisor) delegates tasks to other agents assigning values and interacting with memory in a feedback loop. Together, the committee of agents work in parallel until the overall goal is complete.Within this MAS, each agent is made up of an internal structure that allows it to function both independently and collaboratively within its system. This collaboration is dependent on shared memory stores which provide context regarding individual knowledge, past experiences and belief states</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both agentic AI and generative AI offer productivity benefits by assisting, augmenting, and optimizing tasks and processes Both are forms of AI that use LLMsWhen comparing the two, think of agentic AI as proactive and generative AI as reactive.Agentic AI is a system that can proactively set and complete goals with minimal human oversight. If part of accomplishing that goal involves creating content, generative AI tools handle that task. Agentic AI becomes an agent of the user and/or system.Generative AI is a tool that creates new content in reaction to a prompt. It can be a component of an agentic system, but it doesn&#8217;t act on its own to complete a task. It has no agency.Agentic AI and generative AI do work collaboratively. Agentic AI systems may use generative AI to converse with a user, independently create content as part of a greater goal, or communicate with external tools generative AI is a critical part of agentic AI&#8217;s 'cognitive' process Both types of AI are adaptable in their own way. Generative AI expresses its adaptability by producing content in many styles and for different contexts Agentic AI showcases its adaptability by adjusting its plan and strategy in response to changing environmental conditions or new information.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine a sales representative wants to use AI to write a follow-up email to a sales lead.With generative AI, the sales representative opens a generative AI interface and enters a prompt like, 'Write a polite and professional follow-up email to Maria Wang about our proposal.' The generative AI produces a draft of the email and has fulfilled its purpose. It&#8217;s now up to the sales representative to copy that text, paste it into an email, enter the recipient&#8217;s email address and hit send.Now let&#8217;s explore how agentic AI would handle a similar task.Within an agentic system, the sales representative sets a rule or command in their customer relationship management (CRM) system. It might read something like, 'For any sales lead I mark as 'Follow-up required,' wait two business days then send a follow-up email.'Once the sales representative marks Maria Wang as 'Follow-up required,' the agentic workflow is triggered. The system has its instructions (the initial prompt) and independently lays out a plan to enact with the help of external tools The plan may look something like this</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Process Step
The system retrieves Maria&#8217;s details from the CRM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Process Step
Another tool fetches additional information about Maria (customer history, personalization details company information, etc.) that provides context for the prompt for the follow-up email.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Process Step
The system creates a prompt for the follow-up email and provides it to an integrated gen AI model, which writes the email text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Process Step
The system provides a draft of the follow-up email to the sales representative, who approves the email or sends it back to redraft.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Process Step
If the sales representative approves the email, the system makes an application programming interface (API) call to Maria&#8217;s email service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Process Step
The system sends the email to Maria.</p>

This initial greetingalso known as a capability discoveryconfirms that the MCP client and the MCP server can talk to each other.During the handshake protocol, the MCP client and the MCP server swap critical information to ensure they&#8217;re compatible. The client shares which capabilities it has and which version of MCP it understands In return, the server shares which capabilities it supports and which tools and resources it can provide to the client.</p>
